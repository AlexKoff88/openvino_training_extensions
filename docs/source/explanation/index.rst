Explanation
=========

This section consist of main algorithms explanation and additional features description.
``Main algorithms`` section inludes description of dataset format, available templates (backbones),
description of supervised training pipelines as well as Semi-supervised and Self-supervised algorithms
for each task separately.

``Additional features`` section gives a brief overview of model optimization algorithms,
hyper parameters optimization and Auto-configuration algorithm to select
appropriate template for a given dataset.
