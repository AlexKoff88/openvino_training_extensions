Explanation
===========

This section consists of an algorithms explanation and describes additional features that are supported by OTX.
``algorithms`` section includes a description of all supported algorithms:

1. Description of supported datasets formats for each task;
2. Available templates and models;
3. Description of supervised training pipelines;
4. Incremental learning approach;
5. Semi-supervised and Self-supervised algorithms;
6. Additional algorithm-specific features such as tiling method for Instance Segmentation and Rotated Object Detection.

``Additional features`` section consists of:

1. Overview of model optimization algorithms;
2. Hyper parameters optimization functionality (HPO);
3. Auto-configuration algorithm to select the most appropriate training pipeline for a given dataset.
