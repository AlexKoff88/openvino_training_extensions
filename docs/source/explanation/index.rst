This section consist of main algorithms explanation and additional features description.
``Main algorithms`` section inludes:

1. Description of datasets format for each task;
2. Available templates (models);
3. Description of supervised training pipelines;
4. Semi-supervised and Self-supervised algorithms.

``Additional features`` section consists of:

1. Brief overview of model optimization algorithms;
2. Hyper parameters optimization (HPO);
3. Incremental learning functionality;
4. Auto-configuration algorithm to select appropriate template for a given dataset.
