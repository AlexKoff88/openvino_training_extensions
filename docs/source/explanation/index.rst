Explanation
=========

This section consist of main algorithms explanation and additional features description.
Main_algorithms section inludes description of dataset format, available templates (backbones),
description of supervised training pipeline as well as Semi-supervised and Self-supervised algorithms
for each task separately.

Additional_features section includes brief description of model optimization algorithm,
hyper parameters optimization, Datumaro support and Auto-configuration algorithm to select
